## About the Hobsec

I'm Bruno Zilio, Founder and CEO of Hobsec. In 2018, with only 14 years old, I found a big problem in the market, small and medium-sized companies did not have software or information security area, as it is a big investment and does not generate immediate profit. In fact, we only see how profitable it is to invest in security when we are hacked, and our customers that we work hard to win, end the partnership due to insecurity. I built an open-source startup, whose mission is to build cybersecurity solutions with an experience and quality of service that allows companies to increase the security of their products and services, thus enabling companies of any branch to have access to safety. We were created to improve security for companies so they can focus on growing their business instead of wasting time on complicated technical processes. through a platform built from scratch, built with a focus on digital business needs, we create a brilliant, easy and humanized experience. Hobsec is the leader in integrated cyber intelligence solution in Latin America. We are responsible for ensuring the security of +40 startups and impacting +82MM users.
